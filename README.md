Hi welcome my newest site which will eventually be my portfolio. This site will be updated many times so please read this file for updates.

Latest Update: (January 13th, 2023)
-Removed the cards from the home page.
-Decided to make the website one page only with all the information hidden with UI Elements and reveal on hover.
-Will use 3 circles to seperate Projects, Certifications, and Contact Me.
-When one category is selected, AKA the circle, 3-4 other circles with information will reveal themselves with an animation and on hover, it will grow bigger and animate more information about the category.
-Kept the typwewriter animation (might change the animation, but generally it should be the same concept)

Previous Update: (January 12th, 2023)
-Uploaded all the files for the first version of the website. Nothing is final especially at this stage of development.
-Cards idea is valueable and will change from the languages to my projects and wondering if I should use the same for my certifications.
-Navigation menu at the top is still not final and might look different later on.
-Color schemes will be different and a light/dark mode toggle will be added later on.
-Card stacking will be tricky so will need to learn to manage them.
