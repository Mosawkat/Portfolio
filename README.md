Hi welcome my newest site which will eventually be my portfolio. This site will be updated many times so please read this file for updates.

Lastest Update: (January 12th, 2023)
-Uploaded all the files for the first version of the website. Nothing is final especially at this stage of development.
-Cards idea is valueable and will change from the languages to my projects and wondering if I should use the same for my certifications.
-Navigation menu at the top is still not final and might look different later on.
-Color schemes will be different and a light/dark mode toggle will be added later on.
-Card stacking will be tricky so will need to learn to manage them.
